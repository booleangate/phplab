Hi there,

To install this bad boy, there are only a few steps.

Application Installation
------------------------
This applications expects to be served from the document root and ran on Apache with mod_rewrite and .htaccess enabled, and mysqli.

This was tested with PHP 5.5.


Database Setup
------------------------
Create a database and create the tables that are defined in tables.sql.


Application Configuration
------------------------
Edit the DB_* defines in config.php to reflect your local database environment.


Test Data Generation
------------------------
There's a simple Bash script at bin/generate-test-data.sh that will aide in the creation of test data.

./generate-test-data.sh localhost 15 3000000

This will create 3,000,000 scores with 15 background threads by calling a API endpoint on the host specified.  The script will complete almost immediately but you'll have to check on the status of the
threads yourself.  You'll see some output when everything is done.


REST API Endpoints
------------------------

Adding a New Score.

	POST /api/score HTTP/1.1
	Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

	signed_request=cjv1NZlSRCthYq9rAyWEidD7QE98p0PKZvVwpQ7gPwg.eyJhbGdvcml0aG0iOiJITUFDLVNIQTI1NiIsImV4cGlyZXMiOjEzMjI4NTYwMDAsImlzc3VlZF9hdCI6MTMyMjg1MDc1NCwib2F1dGhfdG9rZW4iOiJBQUFCelMwYVhTMDBCQUlob0I1bmhrYnZJU0xLSGpNb3ZIN2ZTTmMzWkFxbnVNT2NvYmpJUHoxNGFmWXV1dzBkbkZzeVpBV2JHU2MycXZBakdjRzZUQ1RWZzBLOUVGUWJ5WkJwNTU0ZXE5M2FTWkFXZXpVeEYiLCJ1c2VyIjp7ImNvdW50cnkiOiJ1cyIsImxvY2FsZSI6ImVuX1VTIiwiYWdlIjp7Im1pbiI6MjF9fSwidXNlcl9pZCI6IjEwMDAwMzI5MTY2MTkwOSJ9&user_score=75834

The Facebook signed request is used to determine not only the validity and user ID of the request, but also the time of the request (the `issued_at` field).
Also, the request is expected to not have expired.

Reports: How Many Players?

	GET /api/report/countUsers

Reports: How Many Players Today (How Many Scored Today)?

	GET /api/report/countUsersToday

Reports: Top 10 Players

	GET /api/report/topScorers

Reports: Top 10 Gainers

	GET /api/report/topGainers

These are players with the most improved scores over last week.

Testing: Generate Data

	POST /api/test/generate?count=50000

Creates 50,000 test scores.  The scores will have random dates (in the range of 3 weeks ago to today), scores, and user IDs (100,000 possible users)
